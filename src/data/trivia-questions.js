    claim: "5G has caused the Virus.",
    fact: false,
    explanation:
      "The Covid-19 pandemic is caused by a novel form of a coronavirus and there is no evidence that 5G technology has any effect on people’s health at all. Scientists have made it clear that there is no link between 5G and coronavirus.  A connection with the virus is ‘both a physical and biological impossibility'. This is a conspiracy theory that has come about as a result of false information online. Damaging telecoms infrastructure is particularly dangerous and anyone responsible for these criminal acts will face the full force of the law.",

  {
    claim:
      "If you have COVID and aren’t showing symptoms you won’t transmit the disease.",
    fact: false,
    explanation:
      "Not everyone who has COVID-19 has symptoms and it can take up to 14 days to show symptoms in some cases. In reality, we don't yet know exactly how many people might be completely asymptomatic (meaning that you don't show symptoms) while carrying the virus, but studies show it could be a high number. That's why it's so important to self-isolate for at least 14 days if you either live with someone who might have the virus or you've been instructed to by a contact tracer, and why keeping a safe distance from others is essential.",

  {
    claim:
      "Covid only affects older people, so young people don’t have to worry about it.",
    fact: false,
    explanation:
      "This is incorrect, and the death rate is likely to be 5 or 10 times higher than this. However, it should be noted that the relative fatality of coronavirus is greatly affected by exogenous factors such as previous health conditions, age, and other factors such as smoking or obesity.",
  },
  {
      claim: "COVID-19 is man-made.",
      fact: false,
      explanation: "Scientists from across the world have disproved this theory. Research firmly determines that coronavirus is a result of a naturally occurring process and not a product of laboratory engineering. New diseases have emerged throughout human history, and we have seen two other major coronavirus outbreaks in the last two decades: SARS and MERS. The COVID-19 pandemic is not a hoax, it is a global outbreak caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2."

  {
      claim: "Getting the vaccine will make me sick",
      fact: false,
      explanation: "After being vaccinated you may feel feverish, tired or sore, as your immune system is fighting a piece of the virus. The COVID-19 vaccinations contain either an mRNA segment or a viral vector, neither of which are able to cause an infection. mRNA and the viral vector contain the instructions for your cells to make only a piece of the virus, which allows your immune cells to recognize the virus if you come into contact with it again. It takes time for the body to develop protection against the virus, so you can still be infected with COVID-19 after being vaccinated. If you come into contact with the virus or an infected person shortly after receiving the shot, your immune system is not fully prepared to fight off the infection, and you may become ill."
  },
  {
      claim: "The vaccine will change my DNA",
      fact: false,
      explanation: "The mRNA in the vaccine never enters the nucleus, which is where DNA is stored. The mRNA is not able to change DNA, and it will not alter a person's genetic makeup or reproductive cells."
  },
  {
      claim: "Being around vaccinated people is dangerous",
      fact: false,
      explanation: "Vaccinated people can not 'shed' the virus or infect others, as the vaccine doesn't include the instructions to make an entire virus, only a piece of it."
  },
  {
   claim: "COVID-19 vaccines cause variants.",
   fact: false,
   explanation: "New variants of a virus happen because the virus that causes COVID-19 constantly changes through a natural ongoing process of mutation (change).  As the virus spreads, it has more opportunities to change. High vaccination coverage in a population reduces the spread of the virus and helps prevent new variants from emerging."
  },
  {
      claim: "COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips.",
      fact: false,
    explanation: "COVID-19 vaccines do not contain microchips. Vaccines are developed to fight against disease and are not administered to track your movement."
  },
  {
      claim: "Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine can make you magnetic.",
      fact: false,
      explanation: "COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection. All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals."
  },
  {
      claim: "COVID-19 vaccines can alter my DNA.",
      fact: false,
      explanation: "COVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way."
  },
  {
      claim: "Pfizer vaccine will make women boobs grow up to 2 sizes.",
      fact: true,
      explanation: "The mRNA vaccines deliver a small amount of genetic code to instruct cells how to replicate the virus’ surface protein ‘spike’, which in turn activates the immune system. Lymph nodes contain B-cells that use this information to generate antibodies in response to a foreign entity. The buildup of antibodies in the lymph nodes may result in them becoming enlarged. This can lead to breasts feeling larger for a short time following a COVID vaccine, but it is not cause for undue concern."
  },
  {
       claim: "A new study shows hydroxychloroquine can increase Covid-19 survival rates by 200%.", 
       fact: false,
       explanation: "This very small study has not been peer-reviewed and it does not show that hydroxychloroquine can effectively treat Covid-19."
  },
  {
      claim: "Covid vaccine will turn people into crocodiles.",
      fact: false,
      explanation: "Despite the delusional claim of Brazilian President Bolsonaro, scientists would like to remind that you will NOT turn into a crocodile or a bearded lady if you vaccinate against covid-19."
